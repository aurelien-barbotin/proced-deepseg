DL for microscopy
=================

A collection of scripts to perform deep-learning segmentation of bacterial cells labeled with membrane markers and the analysis of the corresponding results. Named after https://henriqueslab.github.io/resources/ZeroCostDL4Mic/ and some models were created using this ressource.

Contains scripts for image segmentation and segmentation analysis. Image segmentation is performed using one of three models:
 - Cellpose: either the general model, or our home-trained model on B. subtilis images labeled with NileRed
 - Omnipose:the general model
 - delta

Each of these three methods runs in a different virtual environment (to avoid conflicts).

Usage
-------
On Windows:

This offers workflows for
 - Image segmentation (folder 1_segmentation)
 - Segmentation analysis (folder 1_analysis)

Scripts to run submethods are located in corresponding subfolders. For instance, to run segmentation with omnipose, copy the images to process in the folder 1_segmentation/omnipose/to_process/ (create it if it does not exist). Then double click on `run_segmentation.bat`. A terminal should open which gives update on the progress.


Install
-------
This package contains several scripts that run in different virtual environments. Batch scripts can be found in subdirectories, which paths need to be updated when installed on a new computer. Installation of specific libraries within these virtualenvs is necessary. Virtual environments necessary to run these scripts include

It is required to install dl_for_mic in a virtual environment, typically using anaconda:

```
conda create -n dl_for_mic
conda activate dl_for_mic
pip install -e path
```

### omnipose
A Virtualenv necessary to run omnipose. Follow the instructions of the official page: https://pypi.org/project/omnipose/
Microsoft Visual C++ is necessary.

### cellpose
So far it is expecting a `deepseg` environment. The processing script also needs to know the path to the custom models.IT can be the same environment as dl_for_mic as cellpose is a requirement of dl_for_mic. This may change in a near future.

### delta
Expects a Virtualenv named `delta_env`. Installation is tricky and should follow the official instructions.
