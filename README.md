# proced-deepseg

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/459509999.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15384360)

A collection of Python scripts to perform deep-learning segmentation of bacterial cells and corresponding analysis. These scripts are mainly intended for members of the ProCeD lab who don't code, but can be used by others.

## Usage

This offers workflows for
 - Image segmentation (folder 1_segmentation)
 - (optional) postprocessing (folder 1b_postprocessing): to remove masks on the edge of an image
 - Segmentation analysis (folder 2_analysis): to extract doubling times (requires extra processing on trackmate) or cell morpholgy
 
An up-to-date list of protocols achievable with this program is available [here](https://github.com/aurelien-barbotin/proced-deepseg/blob/main/protocols/). Scripts to run submethods (e.g segmentation) are located in corresponding subfolders. For instance, to run segmentation with omnipose, copy the images to process in the folder 1_segmentation/omnipose/to_process/ (create it if it does not exist). Then double click on `run_segmentation.bat`. A terminal should open which gives update on the progress.

Information can be extracted from masks using scripts in 2_analysis. This information can be either the cellular morphology (and its variation with frames) or cellular doubling times. Extraction of doubling times requires tracking with Trackmate, a plugin available in Fiji. A complete protocol and exemple for cellular doubling time extraction can be found here:

## Install

This package contains several scripts that run in different virtual environments. Batch scripts can be found in subdirectories, which paths need to be updated when installed on a new computer. Installation of specific libraries within these virtualenvs is necessary. Virtual environments necessary to run these scripts include

It is required to install proced_deepseg in a virtual environment, typically using anaconda:

```
conda create -n proced_deepseg_env python=3.11
conda activate proced_deepseg_env
pip install -e path
```

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is preferable to install the different segmentation libraries in different virtual environments. To run the segmentation methods with a batch script, it will be necessary to update the names and paths of virtual environments.

## Segmentation models

Image segmentation can be performed using one of three models:
 - Cellpose: either the general model, or our home-trained model on B. subtilis images labeled with NileRed
 - Omnipose: either the general model for phase contrast data, or the model for fluorescence imaging
 - delta

Each of these three methods runs in a different virtual environment (to avoid conflicts).

### omnipose
A Virtualenv necessary to run omnipose. Follow the instructions of the official page: https://pypi.org/project/omnipose/
Microsoft Visual C++ is necessary. Last checked, works for omnipose==0.4.4 but not for omnipose>1 For omnipose_custom, you also need to update the path to the custom omnipose model. Based on how it was trained, you also might need to change the parameter 'nchan'.

### cellpose
So far it is expecting a `deepseg` environment. The processing script also needs to know the path to the custom models.IT can be the same environment as dl_for_mic as cellpose is a requirement of dl_for_mic. This may change in a near future.

### delta
Expects a Virtualenv named `delta_env`. Installation is tricky and should follow the official instructions.
